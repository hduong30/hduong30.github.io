			 A poem’s content is what the poem is about and what the author includes in the lines. This could be dialogue, descriptions, meditations on a specific theme, and more. A poem is defined by its content. Without content, there is no poem. It is everything that the author includes in their verse, except the form.

			<p class="s2">Literature</p>
			<p class="content">The content is everything the author includes in their book, story, essay, or poem. This ranges from the characterization to plot, setting, and resolution. The only things not included in content are the elements of form or how the literary work is structured. Some of the many elements of content in literature are dialogue, setting, exposition, conflict, plot, characterization, resolution, moral, theme, and resolution.</p>

		<p class="s3">Music</p>
			<p class="content">In other words, whether creating (e.g., composing), performing (e.g., live or studio rendition), or ‘just listening’ to music, the experience is entirely semiotic. Others’ answers emphasize the emotive aspects of musical “content,” but I believe that view narrowly constrains the variety and depth of musical experience and confuses cause and effect in musical contexts, as I’ll explain below.</p>
